libpng for Marmalade
====================

This module can be used to build the libpng library into Marmalade
applications.

The source is downloaded and compiled unmodified from www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html

    libpng-1.2.34.tar.bz2

The included example pngtest.mkb will build the lib and run simple tests.
